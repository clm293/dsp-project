# CS 4740 Digital Signal and Image Processing
# Final Project
# May 2019

The goal of this project is to implement an algorithm that automatically segments brain MRIâ€™s into anatomically significant regions of interest. This is an area of ongoing research at the intersection of the medical and image processing fields which will be increasingly utilized for diagnostic and treatment evaluation purposes as the reliability of the technology continues to improve.
In particular, the focus is on identifying the regions of cerebral cortex and cerebral white matter at the middle coronal slice.
